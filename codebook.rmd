This document describes the code inside run_analysis.R.

##The code is splitted in some sections:

Manipulating data 

Writing final data to txt file


###Manipulating data:

Read y_test.txt & y_train.txt as activityTestData & activityTrainData

Read subject_test.txt & subject_train.txt as subjectTestData & subjectTrainData

Read X_test.txt & X_train.txt as featuresTestData & featuresTrainData

Read features.txt as featureNames

Read activity_labels.txt as acitivityNames

Rbind acticityTestData & activityTrainData as acitivityData

Rbind subjectTestData & subjectTrainData as subjectData

Rbind featuresTestData & featuresTrainData as featuresData

Assign names "activity" & "subject" to activityData & subjectData

Assigne feature names to featuresData

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

   Cbind featuresData, activityData & subjectData

* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

   Use grep() function to find the feature names that match "mean()" & "std()"

   Use subset() function to query the subset with matching patterns

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

   Loop function to replace activity numbers to activity labels

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

   Use gsub() function to subisitute the short variable names to descriptive variable names

###Writing final data to txt file

* creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
   Load plyr library and use aggregate() function to get the average values of each varialbe for each activity and each subject

   Use write.table() function to generate tidyDataSet.txt
